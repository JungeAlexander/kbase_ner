# ü™ê spaCy Project: NER in kbase

Named entity recognition for documents in kbase using spacy.

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `download` | Download the pretrained pipeline |
| `convert` | Convert the data to spaCy's binary format, removing all non-NER annotation. |
| `create-config` | Create a config for updating only NER from an existing pipeline |
| `train` | Update the NER model |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate the model and export metrics |
| `package` | Package the trained model as a pip package |
| `visualize-model` | Visualize the model's output interactively using Streamlit |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `download` &rarr; `convert` &rarr; `create-config` &rarr; `train` &rarr; `evaluate` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`assets/20210320-glue-dir-kbase-dev-sagemaker-ground-truth/train.spacy`](assets/20210320-glue-dir-kbase-dev-sagemaker-ground-truth/train.spacy) | Local | Annotated training data, preprocessed and stored in spacy's binary format. |
| [`assets/20210320-glue-dir-kbase-dev-sagemaker-ground-truth/dev.spacy`](assets/20210320-glue-dir-kbase-dev-sagemaker-ground-truth/dev.spacy) | Local | Annotated development data, preprocessed and stored in spacy's binary format. |
| [`assets/20210320-glue-dir-kbase-dev-sagemaker-ground-truth/test.spacy`](assets/20210320-glue-dir-kbase-dev-sagemaker-ground-truth/test.spacy) | Local | Annotated test data, preprocessed and stored in spacy's binary format. |

## Setup

### Dependencies

Dependencies are managed via poetry:

```
poetry install --no-root
```

All commands in this README need to be run in a poetry shell which can be activated as follows:

```
poetry shell
```

### Project structure

The project structure is based on a spacy example project structure obtained as follows and
then adjusted:

```
python -m spacy project clone pipelines/ner_demo_update
```

## Documentation

To update the auto-generated parts of the documentation, run:

```
python -m spacy project document --output README.md
```
